# Software requirements

<br />

Before you start to work with App Framework, you need to install some free available softare.

## Atom

First of all, you need a code editor. We really recommend Atom, which is open source, supports correct syntax highlighting and is available for macOS, Windows and Linux.

1. Download from [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) the right installer for your operating system
2. Install Atom and open it afterwards
3. Select the *Welcome* tab, disable the checkbox *Show welcome guide when opening Atom* and close the tab
4. Select the *Telemetry Consent* tab and decide whether you want to send statistics or not to Atom
5. Open from the top menu *File > Settings* and select in the left menu *Install*
6. Search for package `language-vue-component` and click on *install*
7. Search for package `linter-eslint` and click on *install*
8. Search for package `editorconfig` and click on *install*
9. Close the settings tab and Atom itself

## Node.js

To run the App Framework scripts and the development server, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which is available for macOS, Windows and Linux and is free of charge. You can install it with the default settings.

## Xcode

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is optional. You need it, if you want to publish your application to the Apple App Store. You can install Xcode only to macOS machines, like iMac or macBook. You can download Xcode free of charge from the macOS App Store.

## Android Studio

Android Studio is optional. You need it, if you want to publish your application to the Google Play Store. It is available free of charge for macOS, Windows and Linux.

To ensure you install Android Studio and its SDK properly, please read the [official installation guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html).

### On Linux

Please take care to unpack Android Studio to one of the following locations to ensure that App Framework will find the *studio.sh* file:

- /bin/android-studio/bin/studio.sh
- /opt/android-studio/bin/studio.sh
- /usr/bin/android-studio/bin/studio.sh
- /usr/local/android-studio/bin/studio.sh
- /usr/local/bin/android-studio/bin/studio.sh

## GitHub desktop client

The GitHub desktop client is optional. We recommend it as a Git client, because GitHub is great for collaboration or as a backup for your own code. The desktop client is available for macOS and Windows and is free of charge.

1. Create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/join)
2. Download from [GitHub.com](https://desktop.github.com/) the right installer for your operating system
3. Install the GitHub desktop client and log in with your credentials
4. Configure your user name and a email address under which you will commit to GitHub
5. Close the GitHub desktop client

## Reboot

At the end of the installation process, you should reboot your computer.
